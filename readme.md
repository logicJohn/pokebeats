This is my first commit

The purpose of this application is to serve as 3 microservices being automatically pushed to a google cloud instance

1. front end service that takes in the name of a pokemon
2. service that searches a pokemons name by  its type using pokedex api
3. service that queries a spotify playlist? creates a spotify playlist.  Need to look more into the capabilites of spotify.

may need to combine 1 and 3 into one service.y
